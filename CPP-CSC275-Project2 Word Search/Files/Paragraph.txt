This is not Microsoft’s greatest generation. The Xbox One has a serious exclusive games problem. 
But that doesn’t mean there aren’t compelling reasons to buy the console.

In fact, being an underdog seems to have convinced the team at Xbox to get scrappy and creative. 
Microsoft is blurring the lines between console and PC gaming, while offering services that its competitors simply can’t. 
And the Xbox One X is the most powerful console available — something Microsoft has worked tirelessly to communicate to the world.

The future looks bright, too.
 At E3 2018, Microsoft announced the acquisition of five studios — 
The Initiative, Undead Labs, Playground Games, Ninja Theory and Compulsion Games. 
Its situation looks to be improving. 
Whether or not Microsoft’s adjustments will buttress the Xbox One or whatever comes next, we’ll have to wait and see.

Against the backdrop of an underperforming console generation, Microsoft bolstered the Xbox One with backward compatibility, 
bringing millions of people’s Xbox and Xbox 360 libraries to the modern hardware at no added cost. 
A handful of the hundreds of backward-compatible games go a step further, 
benefiting from the upgraded power of the Xbox One X with improved resolution.
